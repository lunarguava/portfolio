  <p>Lunar Guava is a droplet from the core of the moon that descended upon the earth to bring mellifluous grooves and toons to the mortal inhabitants of this planet. 
    They use several tools to weild the power of sonic resonance including but not limited to saxophone, bass, guitar, piano, drums, and peculiar technological devices deviced by humans such as laptops and the various programs within them allowing a stupendous array of manipulation to encur to the waves of sound.

  <p>There are many other beings in this realm that have influenced the production of these decorations of time. From deep wubs, to various rappers and punk groups, indie bands, and even oldies and street performers. 
    The general development and progression of "music" as a whole over the past century is as extraordinary as are many of the discoveries and expansions in the other sciences.
    It's this increase in activity that drew me to the surface....
  </p>
  <p>It is my intent to inspire the individuals and collectives here to glance beyond the viel of their desires and predicaments. 
    To become aware of the subtlties in the frequencies. 
    The expansiveness of meditative funk may be the foundations of a new kind of realm.
    One where there are no lines in the soil or heirachies of cruelty. 
    One where my lover's precious nature is preserved, admired, and cherished.
